# Morphing of and writing with a scissor linkage mechanism

## Forward kinematics, shape morphing and writing with scissor mechanism

This repository contains python notebooks implementing the **series solution** described in the article *Morphologies of a sagging elastica with intrinsic sensing and actuation*.  
The work investigates the equilibrium shapes of a slender elastica under gravity when augmented with **intrinsic sensing and distributed actuation**. The feedback strategy is modeled via convolution with Gaussian kernels, and both **local** and **nonlocal** sensing/actuation regimes are considered.
